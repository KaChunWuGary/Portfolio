# Portfolio

This project is to display my knowledge in coding and the different project's I've done. 

Things that are looked at are:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work <br>

WHEN I load their portfolio <br>
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them <br>

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation <br>
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section <br>

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work <br>
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications <br>

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application <br>
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others <br>

WHEN I click on the images of the applications <br>
THEN I am taken to that deployed application <br>

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices <br>
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport <br>
