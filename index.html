<!-- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and 
links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport -->

                         My name is Ka Chun Wu. I also go by Gary. I am currently working as a veterinary assistant in Pleasanton, California. Although I received my B.S.in Biology from UC Riverside,
                         coding has always been a thing that fascinated me. I took a quarter while I was getting my bachelors, and had always planned to eventually do more with coding. If I am able to start a 
                         career in this field, I would like to eventually go into cybersecurity.
